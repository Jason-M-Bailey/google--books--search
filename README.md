# Google Books Search

[Deployed Application](https://google--books--search--jmb.herokuapp.com/)
### Overview

A new React-based Google Books Search app, using Node, Express and MongoDB and the Google Books API to search and save books to a list. 


### Bonus Live Updates to Saved Books

* Use React routing and [socket.io](http://socket.io) to create a notification or a component that triggers whenever a user saves an book. Your message should include the title of the saved book.

  * Say you have multiple browsers open, each one visiting your site. If you save an book in one browser, then all of your browsers should notify you that a new book was saved.

  * [Socket.io NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io)
